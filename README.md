# CUHK CSCI3260 Principles of Computer Graphics 2022

This Repository contains the demo code provided by CUHK, the two assignments done by me, and the project code completed by me and my groupmate.

The codes are no where near perfect, but I have tried my best to make them as structured as possible.
